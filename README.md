# Getting Started with MetaWar

MetaWar is a play-and-earn web based NFT metaverse game with a full three.js built in. Through a variety of collecting and trading features, street battles, PvE, PvP, and syndicate events such as wars, MetaWar aims to provide a source of amusement for both casual players and diehard DeFi aficionados.

Three factions in great turmoil, thrust into war over resources, grudges, and ideology in our MetaWar.

The overzealous Super Empire, a wealthy nation obsessed with body-modification, faith, and purity.
Econo, a hyper industrial republic, run by gleeful, brutish engineers who always honor their word.
And Peace, a massive tree that stretches into the heavens, inhabited by what appears to be a peace-loving down-to-earth society of naturalists.

“Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster. And if you gaze long enough into an abyss, the abyss will gaze into itself.”

The Sundering had begun.
During this brief moment, the powerful gems that became known as cyberstones spread across the plane of Eld.
With them came the corrupt beings and aberrations of the Abyss that quickly unleashed turmoil upon Eld, multiplying the agony of its inhabitants.
Forced to abandon their lands to great despair, they withdrew to the capitals of Econo, Peace and Super Empire.
Compelled to place deep-seated generational hatred aside, the long-sworn enemies reluctantly came together to fight this chiefest of all calamities. The leaders of each faction solemnly swore to try and set aside their endless war to face off against the existential threat of the Abyss.
This union resulted in the creation of the CyberPersons, mighty robot units powered by cyberstones with a single purpose: forming the last line of defense the capitals have to push back the primordial forces unleashed by the Abyss.
Commanded by remote expert Pilots in teams of four, CyberPersons are the ultimate weapon of war.
